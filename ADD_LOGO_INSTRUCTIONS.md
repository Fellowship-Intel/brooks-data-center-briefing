# How to Add Your Fellowship Intelligence Logo

## Quick Steps

1. **Save the logo image** to this location:
   ```
   static/images/logo.png
   ```

2. **Supported formats:**
   - PNG (recommended)
   - JPG/JPEG
   - SVG

3. **Recommended size:**
   - Width: 200-400px
   - Maintain aspect ratio

## File Path
The complete path should be:
```
G:\My Drive\Cursor\Brooks\static\images\logo.png
```

## What Happens Next

Once you save the logo file:
- ✅ The logo will automatically appear at the top of the Streamlit sidebar
- ✅ It will be styled with a dark background container matching your theme
- ✅ The logo will be responsive and scale with the sidebar
- ✅ If the file isn't found, a text version will display instead

## Testing

After adding the logo:
1. Restart your Streamlit app (if it's running)
2. The logo should appear at the top of the sidebar
3. It will have a dark background container with subtle border

## Troubleshooting

**Logo not showing?**
- Check that the file is named exactly `logo.png`
- Verify it's in `static/images/` directory
- Check file permissions
- Try refreshing the browser (Ctrl+F5)

**Logo looks wrong?**
- Ensure the image has a transparent or dark background
- The logo will be displayed in a dark container
- Adjust image size if needed (200-400px width recommended)
